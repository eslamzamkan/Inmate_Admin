As an admin, I want to easily navigate between different sections (Inmates List, Visitors List,
Schedule Visits, Visits Requests, Visits Recordings, Room Management, and Admin Management)
to efficiently manage and monitor the visitation system.

Description:
The admin dashboard provides multiple functionalities to manage the inmate visitation system.
Admins have access to critical components like visitor and inmate management, visit scheduling,
request handling, viewing visit recordings, and managing room setups. There are also tools
for admin role management. Each function is accessible via the navigation bar and is presented in a clear, organized manner.
